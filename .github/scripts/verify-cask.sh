# A cask's sha256 is a promise about bytes at a URL this repo does not control
# over time: a release can be deleted and re-cut, and the rebuilt DMG will not
# hash the same. The cask then still points at a live URL and `brew install` dies
# with "Cask reports different checksum". Nothing in the release path notices,
# because the bump job checksums what it just built rather than what is published.
#
# So this fetches each per-arch DMG over the same URL Homebrew uses and compares
# it to the sha256 in the cask. Run it after bumping, and on a schedule to catch
# drift introduced after the fact.

# Usage: verify-cask.sh [path/to/cask.rb]
