  caveats <<~EOS
    Open documents from a terminal with `markdn notes.md`, or a folder with
    `markdn ~/notes`.

    markdn serves its UI and an MCP server on 127.0.0.1:43118 while the app is
    running. To let an agent read and write the documents you have open, point an
    MCP client at:

      http://localhost:43118/mcp

    By default it can only touch markdown under your home directory. Narrow that
    by launching with MARKDN_ROOT set to the directory you want it confined to.
